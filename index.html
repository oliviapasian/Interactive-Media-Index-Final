                    <p>Hello! Welcome to my final assignment for Interactive Media: Web, an index of all the work
                        completed throughout the course! I feel that I have learned a lot throughout this course. I came
                        in with a bit of coding experience but I didn't really know how to apply it to design nor did I
                        know much about interactivity. I learned about responsiveness, which looking back at my older
                        coding work makes me cringe to see it resized to smaller screen sizes. I learned a lot about
                        JavaScript, which I wasn't very comfortable with before this class. I also learned a lot of new
                        ways to use CSS, which I had thought I was pretty okay at, but now I've learned so much more and
                        I know I still have a ways to go. Even though this was a condensed class, I feel like a lot of
                        knowledge was packed into the 6 weeks and I am coming out of it a better designer and with a lot
                        more skills I can use in the future. I am excited about what I was able to achieve throughout
                        the course and happy with how I was able to apply my knowledge with this website. </p>

                    <h2>Reading 1: How to Crit</h2>
                    <p><a href="http://howtocrit.com/">How to Crit by Mitch Goldstein</a></p>
                    <p><b>1. What are some challenges you face when giving a critique?</b> </p>
                    <p>I think one thing that challenges me with critique is feeling like I'm being harsh. It never is
                        my intention to be and I don't think I am, but it can feel uncomfortable for me to talk about
                        things that might not be working with someones work. This is because it sometimes can be hard
                        for me to receive "negative" feedback so it can be hard to give it out knowing how I sometimes
                        feel about it. But in the reading, on the main page, the author wrote that "critique serves the
                        work, not the person who made the work", which does change my perspective on it. I of course
                        always stick to the work itself anyway, but reading that and other parts such as "you should
                        walk away from getting a crit feeling empowered and excited to make the work better" does make
                        me feel more comfortable as it reminds me that the purpose is to learn and to improve our work,
                        so as long as feedback is based on that it will be a positive experience.</p>
                    <p><b>2. How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?</b> </p>
                    <p>As I mentioned, something I struggle with is focusing on the educational part of critique and not
                        taking it personally, so I am working on being better about being more receptive to critiques I
                        don't necessarily like or agree with. If I don't agree with something, I still usually consider
                        it anyway before immediately disregarding it because there still might be something to consider
                        with the feedback as they gave it for a reason. This section in the "getting feedback" page was
                        helpful for me with considering this idea: "Everything is up for interpretation — but also note
                        that ignoring what everybody says probably won’t help your work improve." I want to be able to
                        think about ALL the feedback I receive and see what I can use from it.</p>
                    <p><b>3. Why do you think it’s important to give and receive critiques? </b> </p>
                    <p>I think critique is important because it is an opportunity to get other perspectives on your work
                        and see how others might interpret it. I sometimes get feedback about how someone saw my work
                        differently than I intended which gives me insight as to whether I should run with that or
                        change it to match my intentions better. And, since I created the work I usually have an
                        attachment to it, so hearing from others about issues I was too close to see is helpful. I
                        thought this section in the reading was interesting and not something I really considered:
                        "Design school is about being active, not being passive. If you need more, it is up to you to
                        find it." Critique encourages us to use design language and communicate with others about our
                        work, as well as be able to know what questions to ask to get helpful feedback. I think it
                        important to be able to talk about your work and the work of others to better understand design
                        terminology and know what areas need improvement.</p>

                            Chimero</a></p>
                    <p><b>1. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you
                            think one is "better"
                            than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.</b> </p>
                    <p>I don’t have a strong feeling about one or the other. I think it really is just about personal
                        preference rather than
                        one being inherently “better” than the other. I think I’m a bit more on the skeuo side because I
                        think it makes
                        things more clear. By that I mean it adds clarity by adding more detail and texture and 3
                        dimensionality, therefore
                        it looks more real and is easier to identify. With flat, it can be a bit harder to tell exactly
                        what it is sometimes
                        and feels harder on the eyes to me. And as mentioned in the reading, I don’t think it
                        necessarily matters, because a
                        computer will be able to make both visible and there are usually ways to cater to individual
                        preference.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>2. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another
                            example from
                            filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.
                        </b> </p>
                    <p>The zoopraxiscope is something I hadn’t heard of before this reading. It is basically a glass
                        disc with images on it
                        that when spun at high speeds with light behind it creates a moving picture projection. As the
                        reading mentions,
                        it’s similar to design, particularly web and interaction design, because of the focus on
                        movement, the use of
                        screens, and creating interactions using time and change. Another example from filmmaking that I
                        think relates to
                        where we are with digital design would be the addition of colour to film, which began (according
                        to this website
                        here</p>
                    <p><b>3. Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not.
                        </b> </p>
                    <p>I don’t think I agree, I think that screens and digital design has a lot of variety in
                        possibilities. While “flux” or
                        interactive design are arguably the most engaging ways to use a screen, I don’t think screens
                        necessarily “want”
                        flux, I think there are lots of interesting ways to use screens for design that are more static.
                        The author defines
                        flux as “the capacity for change” and uses examples of digital design that are interactive and
                        use movement. I think
                        with web design flux is a very important thing to make use of and consider, but I don’t think
                        screens want or need
                        it, I think it is up to the designer to decide how much or how little flux they use depending on
                        the nature of what
                        they are creating.

                    <p><a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/">Touring Complete User by
                            Olia Lialina
                        </a></p>
                    <p><b>1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?
                        </b> </p>
                    <p>I think Lialina thinks the word “user” is a bit of a double-edged sword, as she describes how
                        there can be an assumption with web developers that users are perhaps more “stupid” (Lialina’s
                        word choice, not mine: “...front end developers, don’t assume that your users are more stupid
                        than you, they are just busy”) for not necessarily being able to write their own code, but there
                        is also a sort of marketing towards users that programming is not fun or not creative (as
                        described in Lialaina’s paragraph about the Adobe marketing: “...the less you think about source
                        code, scripts, links and the web itself, the more creative you are as a web designer”). Lialina
                        also describes the “alienation of users from their computers” which I think ties in with what
                        she think of the word “user”, because I think she sees the word as a way to alienate those who
                        are perhaps less engaged with their computer usage. Lialina also said the following: “I would
                        say it is wrong to say either you understand computers or u are the user”. I think that she
                        feels “users” should not be as alienated from their computers as they are by the usage of the
                        word “user”, and I think she wants there to be more of a spectrum when it comes to how we use
                        computers as opposed to categorising by either someone who understands computers or is a user.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.
                        </b> </p>
                    <p>I think Universal users (which she describes as “users who have the ability to achieve their
                        goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device”) are Lialina’s ideal
                        internet user. She says that a “Universal User’s mind set (it is a mind set, not set of rules,
                        not a vow) means to liaise with hardware and software” and that in terms of Interface Design and
                        UX, this kind of interaction “is the ultimate experience”. She seems to praise the idea of
                        cooperating with technology rather than just using it. Lialina also says that Universal Users
                        “will find a way to their aspiration without an app or utility programmed specifically for it.
                        The Universal user is not a super user, not half a hacker”. Universal Users are many of us to
                        some degree and Lialina is saying that this kind of user is very common and that they are not
                        either a hacker or a regular user, they are their own category of someone who visits websites
                        and makes the experience their own. The idea of escaping the “user” label as a negative term
                        comes up a lot in Lialina’s essay, and so I think her ideal user is someone who is technically a
                        user but escapes the negative connotations of the word by not being “very busy” and instead
                        challenging what computers can do.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps
                            that can be filled by users"?
                        </b> </p>
                    <p>Lialina defined the "gaps that can be filled by users" as “where smoothness and seamlessness are
                        broken and some of the final links in the chain are left for the users to complete”. I think
                        interactive experiences where users can input text or press buttons to customise their
                        experience are the gaps that can be filled by users. An example coming to mind, that I think
                        technically wouldn’t necessarily be a website, would be the Sims games. You can use sliders and
                        colour pickers and buttons to customise a character, name it, and then use controls to design a
                        life for them. I’m sure there is a much better example out there, but I think that kind of
                        interaction where it is very open but also has limitations with what kinds of changes you can
                        make is the kind of gap that users can fill.

                            website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge by Laurel Schwulst
                        </a></p>
                    <p><b>1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree
                            with her? Please explain your answer.
                        </b> </p>
                    <p>I think Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media because she believes that
                        the web is about individuality and creativity rather than about “being powered by a small
                        handful of big corporations—like Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google”. I agree with her, I
                        think the web was created for people to connect with each other and leave their own mark, and
                        individual websites are a really neat form of expression and are a lot more lively than social
                        media. Individual websites create a much more personal experience with the web and they are how
                        we make the web “actually work for people” instead of corporations. I also think that what
                        Schwulst says about steering the web “back to its original architecture simply by having a
                        website“ and how “artists, in particular, could be instrumental in this space—showing the world
                        where the web can go” is further reasoning from her about supporting individual websites. I
                        think that this point about artists having an instrumental role in bringing back the original
                        ideas behind the web is interesting, and I agree because I think the creative and unique web
                        designs from artists are much closer to the original ideas for the web over the massive social
                        media websites that are much less experimental and individual.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites.
                            Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own
                            simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post
                            the link here.
                        </b> </p>
                    <p>I think a website could be like a ball of yarn. It could unspool as you go along and you’d have
                        to keep unspooling to reach the end. The website could curve in unpredictable ways or it could
                        be pulled taut in a line. It could come apart quickly or slowly. It could be any colour you want
                        and maybe the colours change part of the way through. Maybe you weave it into a pattern, like
                        knitting a sweater or crocheting a scarf. You could even pull it apart again and start over.
                        It’s anything you can shape out of a line.

                    <h2>Reading 5: the Poetry of Tools</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://www.are.na/blog/the-poetry-of-tools">The Poetry of Tools by Mindy Seu</a></p>
                    <p><b>1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to
                            'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that
                            action relates to her use of the word poetry?
                        </b> </p>
                    <p>I think the meaning of 'defamiliarizing our tools' is that we are familiar with things like
                        clicking and scrolling to the point where we don't even think about those interactions and we
                        are missing out on opportunity to reconsider those tools as design elements in their own right.
                        Seu poses this question: "How can we reconsider the actions we perform in our daily interfaces?"
                        And then adds that "identifying the constraints of these tools can help us recognize their
                        poetic potential". I think she is saying that while basic web actions can seem mundane, they can
                        be repurposed to create interesting interactions on the web. Poetry is about turning words into
                        an expression of ideas and emotions, so I think the usage of the word poetry is about turning
                        simple web actions into something meaningful.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death,
                            Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, &
                            Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now
                            find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within
                            the chosen definition. Explain why.
                        </b> </p>
                    <p>I think Removing Function from Form is about stripping down web tools to the bare bones and
                        creating designs using only basic interactions and forms. The examples shown are things like
                        shaping a bunch of checkboxes into different designs and composing new designs out of common
                        forms. I think this category is for websites that take simple forms that we see every day and
                        turn them into something different that often is different from the intended purpose. The
                        example I found is this website <a
                            href="http://ascii.designforthe.net/ (Links to an external site.)">here</a>. It makes use of
                        very basic symbols and lays them out into the shapes of houses. The houses are all clickable
                        links and none of it has been styled, like the links turn purple after being clicked and the
                        colours are the original blue of links and a white background. I think it fits in the Removing
                        Function from Form category because it uses very simple forms and minimal styling to create an
                        interesting and unique composition that is not what the symbols and letterforms used were meant
                        for. </p>
